# fNIRS-analysis

This is a repository to provide a set of scripts to complement fNIRS data analysis performed with nirs-toolbox by Ted Huppert et al. (https://bitbucket.org/huppertt/nirs-toolbox/wiki/Home)

In addition to the scripts (/tools), this repository also provides a set of use cases (/usecases) to illustrate potential real-case applications.

Note: there is a further folder with external resources (/ext) that may be required for some of the tools provided.

**Bugs reports and suggestions for improvements would be very appreciated.**
