Here you will following find scripts to complement your fNIRS analysis with nirs-toolbox:

- ***BlockAvg***: generates block average results for each subject based on the conditions available
- ***DPF_calc***: calculates the differential pathlength factor according to wavelength used and subject's age [1]
- ***PHOEBE***: implementation of the algorithm described by Pollonini et al. [2] for signal quality assessment
